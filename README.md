# **👋 Hi there, I'm Sneha!**  

💻 **Senior Software Developer | Backend Specialist**  

With **11 years of experience** in software development, I have a strong background in designing, developing, and scaling **enterprise applications** in **Fintech, Healthcare, and Cloud-based solutions**. I started my career with **Infosys in India**, moved to the **US for my Master’s in Computer Science**, and have since worked at **CVS Health** on critical backend systems and cloud-native applications.

> ☕ **Fun fact:** When I'm not designing secure microservices, you'll find me designing with a paintbrush – acrylics are my weekend language!
